(A)
A-1.How many flip-flops are chained?
2605 DFFs and 26 chains

A-2.How many scan cells in every scan chain, respectively?
100~101¡Ascan chain 1~5 contain 101 cells, scan chain 6~26 contain 100 cells.

A-3.What are the inputs and outputs of these scan chains?
test_siX --> test_soX and where X is 1 to 26

A-4.What is the name of the scan enable pin for your scan chain?
test_se gotten from FAS_dft.scan_path


(B)
B-1.What is the area before scan chain insertion?
228212.038487 um^2

B-2.What is the area after scan chain insertion?
252583.304432 um^2

B-3.How much is the area overhead percentage of scan chain?
(252583.304432-228212.038487)/228212.038487 = 0.10679220126 = 10.6 %

B-4.Try to explain why scan chain introduces area overhead.
We synthesis scan chain and MUX so the area grows up.

(C) Ignore the input external and output external delay.
C-1.How long (ns) is the critical path delay before scan chain insertion?
data arrival time 10.27 + library setup time 0.12 = 10.39 ns

C-2.How long the critical path after scan chain insertion?
data arrival time 10.08 + library setup time 0.31 = 10.39 ns

C-3.How many percent is the path delay overhead?
(10.39-10.39)/10.39 = 0%

C-4.Sometimes, the individual gate delay changes in the critical path. Try to explain why?
Insert MUX and FF will enlarge the parasitic capacitance or we call it the loading , and hence make the delay larger.


(D)
D-1.How many total faults (uncollapsed) are there in the circuit?
103564

D-2.How many patterns do we have?
193

D-3.What is the test coverage (%)?
99.81%

D-4.What is the fault coverage (%)?
99.74%
